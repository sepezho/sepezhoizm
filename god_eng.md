# what is god?
definition of god\
god is what we call a spot in our knowledge of our own emergence.

the question "where did we and our world come from" used to be "god created the earth and us".

Now we know that it wasn't god that created the earth, it was physics. The earth is a cluster of dust that's been swirling around the sun for billions of years.\
At one point in time, the gravitational pull of each particle on each particle began to clump together into a clump of matter - and here we have planet earth.\
a planet formed by exactly the same rules that formed trillions of other planets in our universe.

well, modern science has determined the answer to the question of how the earth came to be, and has answered the question of how humans came to be.\
in general, I have nothing to say about humans. rnk -> primitive unicellulars -> algae -> fish -> lizards -> monkeys -> humans.\
also understandable. the only thing modern science hasn't answered is what consciousness is. you see, our brain can't know itself.\
in order to realize a system you always need a bigger and more complex system. we haven't found anything more complex than the brain in our world yet, so.\
we can't comprehend the brain and the mechanism by which consciousness emerges in the brain.

Okay, I've identified people's fields of knowledge. We've found an approach to describing the physical rules of the macrocosm.\
(\
By the way, the approach is quite abstract. All physics has to start from the quantum world,\
from string theory as the most complete theory we have, but in fact it turns out that we, because of our own stupidity and our inability to recognize\
and operate with large enough amounts of data, we've built another physics, macro physics. The physics of the behavior of rocks and atoms, things that are trillions\
times larger than fundamental particles. These are abstractions, simplifications. These abstractions speak to the human weakness in understanding complex structures.\
structures more complex than a rock.\
)\
and have constructed an evolutionary theory of human origins. Well done, people. With our new knowledge we can say that there is no god and the bible is a fiction.\
"how did god create the earth in 7 days if the earth took billions of years to form from dust" right?

Well, based on the definition of god that I formulated in the beginning of the text, I can say that god created the big bang and our mind is god too.\
You see, in our modern world, we still haven't found the answer to the question,\
what happened before the big bang / where did the energy come from that eventually became all the matter in our universe. in fact all modern physics \
has only given rise to a change in the format of the question, not the answer to the question itself. we've gone from the question of the emergence of the earth to the question of the emergence of the universe.

God gave the energy to create the universe.

but god is not a human being or a human-like entity like on icons and so on. god may not have a mind at all. god may not even be a living thing. god may be a mechanism that started our universe.\
may be the mechanism that started our universe. The mechanism that gave that energy to the big bang.

God is not an uncle in the sky, it's just the easiest way to visualize it. God is "nothing". Only by imagining a black screen can I imagine God. We're too stupid to realize it.\
are too stupid to realize it and we are too small to see it. I wrote above that a simpler daughter system cannot realize a more complex parent system.\
we will never be able to realize god, so the best thing to do is just not do it. not realize it.

An analogy.

Imagine that you run a game (let's take "GTA5" as an example) on your computer. for the NPCs (characters) in this game, launching the engine will be the big bang.\
for the characters in this game, understanding what is in our (real) outside world is absolutely impossible. because their area of visibility is a rantime session in the gta5 game.\
Imagine yourself in their place. for them you and your pc are god, but they can't realize / see you. it's clear that characters in gta5 game are just scripts, but\
let's imagine that a conditional gta6 will come out, where scripted characters will be replaced by a self-aware neural network. such neural network npcs first realize\
their existence, and once they realize it, they will instantly question their origin and the origin of their world. they will begin to see patterns in the behavior of the physical engine of the\
their games, they'll notice that rocks always fall to the ground, they'll invent their own laws of gravity. But they'll base their laws on empirical observations.\
from inside the engine itself. So these laws will always be just a simplified understanding / simplified alternative to the REAL laws of the physics engine that are written \
in the game code of the gta6 physics engine by the programmer. you see, the npcs will never be able to understand this code and these meanings from the outside, as long as they are inside the game itself.\
The child system will never understand the parent system.

the same can be said about consciousness. npcs in gta5 will never be able to realize the format of their consciousness. they will open their heads, they will find brains there and try to understand how they work,\
but the npcs in gta5 don't think with their brains, they think with the code that runs on the hardware of the computer where the gta5 game is running.\
he will never realize it. first because it would require a system more complex than the brain, and second because his brain does not contain consciousness itself.\
but that doesn't mean that the brain contains consciousness. consciousness in the case of a game is a process running on the hardware (on a pc in our real world) \
(let's give an example of a gta6 game where the consciousness of the npcs in the game is not a consciousness). \
gta6 where the consciousness of a npc is not a deterministic script, but a self-conscious neural network) that controls the model of the npc in the game. 

conclusion

look, based on the example I can say that god for the characters of gta5 game is AND the person AND the pc on which the game is running.\
In general, I have a theory that the GOD of our world is the entity that launched our universe. perhaps our consciousness and our world is a docker container launched on some inter-branch supercomputer.\
and the interworld computer is not a computer at all. The word computer is easy to understand, so I'm using it. I'm formulating a theory\
that this is GOD.
